/-!
Project-side quotient API for `F_p[X] / (g)`. The ring/field construction
lives in `HexPolyFp.Quotient.Ring`; this module adds polynomial
evaluation into the quotient and the root-counting / Frobenius degree
theory used by Rabin-style finite-field arguments.

/--
Evaluate a low-to-high quotient-coefficient list at a quotient point.

The list `[c₀, c₁, ...]` denotes `c₀ + β * (c₁ + β * (...))`. This
proof-facing evaluator is used by quotient-field root-count arguments where
the coefficients already live in `F_p[X] / (g)`.

/--
Synthetic quotient coefficients for the divided difference of `cs` at the
base point `α`.

If `P` is represented by `cs`, this list represents the quotient
`(P(T) - P(α)) / (T - α)`. Its length is one less than the input list, which
is the measure used by root-count induction.

/--
If every element of the irreducible quotient is fixed by the `n`th Frobenius
iterate, then the modulus degree divides `n`.

This is the quotient-side order theorem used by Rabin soundness: a nonzero
remainder `r = n % deg(g)` would make every quotient element a root of
`T^(p^r) - T`, contradicting the root-count bound because the quotient has
`p^deg(g)` elements.
