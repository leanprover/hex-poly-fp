/-!
Finite enumerations of bounded-degree `FpPoly` values.

The quotient-cardinality arguments need a Mathlib-free way to list all
canonical representatives with degree below a fixed bound.  This module
enumerates fixed-length coefficient vectors over `ZMod64 p` and maps them to
normalized dense polynomials.
